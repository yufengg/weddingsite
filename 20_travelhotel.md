# Travel

If you plan to fly to Roanoke, plan on traveling to the Roanoke Regional Airport. The hotels below as well as most other hotels offer a complimentary shuttle from the airport.

If you plan to take a train, travel on Amtrak to Lynchburg, and the Smartway bus from Lynchburg to Roanoke http://www.smartwaybus.com/fares.htm. From there you can uber to your hotel.

If you plan to drive to the ceremony, there is parking at Saint Andrew's Church, and at several parking garages in downtown Roanoke http://www.downtownroanoke.org/get-around/parking.
