## I’m flying from out of town, do I need to rent a car?
You can, but you shouldn’t need to. The three hotels with our wedding rate offer free shuttles to and from the Roanoke airport. We will also have shuttles from hotels to the ceremony at 10:00 AM and the reception at 4:30 PM, as well as back to hotels after the ceremony and reception.

## Should I travel in Friday or Saturday?
This is up to you. The ceremony is at 11:00 AM, so many guests will be coming in Friday night. If you are traveling Saturday morning, there is plenty of parking at Saint Andrew’s Church so you can plan on coming directly to the ceremony. If you aren’t driving, you can take a taxi or Uber straight to the Saint Andrew’s, it is about a [10 minute drive](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Roanoke-Blacksburg+Regional+Airport,+5202+Aviation+Dr+NW,+Roanoke,+VA+24012/Saint+Andrews+Catholic+Church,+North+Jefferson+Street,+Roanoke,+VA/@37.3008751,-79.9753894,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x884d0ef211b8d66d:0xd7fad578398cd412!2m2!1d-79.9770414!2d37.3247628!1m5!1m1!1s0x884d0dea3bb13363:0xf3a24fd939b0ed5c!2m2!1d-79.9397602!2d37.2781925).

## Can I bring my child, pet, or pet child?
This event is mainly designed for adults rather than children, pets, or pet children. The ceremony and reception are both indoors, making pets strictly impossible. Well behaved children can be accommodated, just let us know!

## Can I bring my spouse, partner, or friend?
If you would like to bring a plus one but they are not on your invitation, let us know ahead of time so we make sure we have a place setting ready to avoid any awkward last minute scrambling.

## What am I supposed to do for the 5 hours between the ceremony and the reception?
Check into your hotel, take our bus tour up Mill Mountain for lunch, grab some coffee downtown, check out the local market downtown, rest up so you’re ready to dance all night, whatever you like.

## I’m not going to be able to make it to both the ceremony and the reception, can I come to what I can?
Absolutely, we’d love to see you for any part of our day that you can make! We realize that it is a long day, and that everyone is busy, so just let us know when you RSVP what you plan to do.
