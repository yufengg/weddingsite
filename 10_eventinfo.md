## Ceremony
Our wedding ceremony will take place at 11:00 AM on July 2nd at Saint Andrew's Catholic Church, located at 631 N Jefferson St, Roanoke, VA 24016.

## Reception
Our Reception will be at 5:00 PM at the Patrick Henry Ballroom, located at 611 S Jefferson St, Roanoke, VA 24011.

## Intermission: What to do between Ceremony and Reception?
During the Intermission, we set up a trip up the Blue Ridge Mountains for guests interested in a low key excursion. The bus will pick up at Saint Andrew's Church following the ceremony at 12:30 PM and bring anyone who would like to come to the top of Mill Mountain where there is a great view of Roanoke City and an up close view of Roanoke's landmark, the Mill Mountain Star. To quote wikipedia, it's "the world's largest freestanding illuminated man-made star." A light lunch will be available at the top of the mountain. The bus will drop off in central downtown Roanoke at 2:30 PM where you can check out the city market, great coffee, and window shopping. The reception is within walking distance of the bus drop off point.

You are also welcome to skip the bus tour and get lunch downtown, or head back to your hotel for a siesta before a night of lots of food and dancing.
