## Ceremony and Reception
Our wedding ceremony will take place at **11:00 AM on July 2nd** at Saint Andrew's Catholic Church, located at [631 N Jefferson St, Roanoke, VA 24016](https://www.google.com/maps/place/St+Andrews+Catholic+Church/@37.2781925,-79.9419489,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x884d0dea3bb13363:0xf3a24fd939b0ed5c). A shuttle will be available to pick up guests from their hotel between **10:00 AM** and **10:30 AM** and drop off at Saint Andrew’s Church.

The cocktail hour and reception will take place at **5:00 PM** at the Patrick Henry Ballroom, located at [611 S Jefferson St, Roanoke, VA 24011](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Patrick+Henry+Ballroom/@37.2686582,-79.9429987,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x884d0d95fd85ba71:0x2b511063630a78a9). Again, a shuttle will be available to transport guests to and from their hotels and the reception.

## Intermission
During the Intermission, you have 5 hours to do whatever you like! We set up a trip up the Blue Ridge Mountains for guests interested in a low key excursion. After the ceremony, a bus will pick guests up directly from the church and go straight up to the top of Mill Mountain. We can promise the bus will get you where you need to be without actually trekking through the woods. However, there will also be a shuttle back to hotels after the ceremony if you want to check in or change into more comfortable clothes, followed by a pick up at 1:00 PM from hotels up Mill Mountain for anyone interested.  

You are also welcome to skip the bus tour and head back to your hotel for a siesta before a night of lots of food and dancing, or grab lunch downtown and explore the local area.

For those coming up the mountain, a light lunch will be available at the top, and there is a great view of Roanoke City and an up close view of Roanoke's landmark, the Mill Mountain Star. To quote Wikipedia, it's "the world's largest freestanding illuminated man-made star <sup>[citation needed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)</sup>.” 

Buses will bring guests back down the mountain between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM and drop off at hotels and central downtown Roanoke where you can check out the city market, great coffee, and window shopping. The reception is within walking distance of the downtown bus drop off point. For those who went back to their hotel, a shuttle will be available to pick guests up at 4:30 and drop off at the Patrick Henry Ballroom for the cocktail hour and reception.
