### About Yufeng, by Deirdre

I met Yufeng at the very start of my first year at Johns Hopkins. On the third day of pre-season for Cross Country/Track, I sat beside him on a bus as the team drove to a long run practice outside of Baltimore. We talked the whole hour ride there, and then again on the way back to campus. I had never met anyone that seemed to love running more than I did. He was an amazing listener--he is the most engaged person you could ever talk to. We started dating a month after meeting, and have now been together for five and a half years. Yufeng studied biomedical engineering in college, and has since been working at Google as a Software Developer Advocate, where he travels to teach other software engineers how to use Google products. I think the job was designed for him, because he loves meeting new people, loves teaching, and is always learning. He retained the childhood wonder that most of us forget, and helps me to try new things and break my overly habitual nature. Yufeng has been amazingly supportive of every goal I have ever had. He has taught me to know what I want, and is truly my biggest advocate. I am so happy to be spending the rest of my life with him.

### About Deirdre, by Yufeng

I met Deirdre at the very start of my fourth and final year at Johns Hopkins. On the first day of pre-season for Cross Country, over two weeks before other students would arrive on campus, the team gathered to meet and introduce ourselves. One particular girl caught my attention. After practice, we all went down to the cafeteria for lunch together. I tried to sit across from her to talk to her, but ended up a few seats away. That was the first time we met face to face. She doesn't remember this. In the weeks that followed, we went on long walks around campus, spotting rabbits and avoiding sprinklers, and enjoyed late-night ice cream at the cafeteria together. I had never met someone with as much interest in ice cream as me. In the years that we have been together, she's been my complement. She has helped guide me through many difficult decisions, keeping the human aspect in balance with my more analytical side. It's hard to describe how connected she is. She cares for others in ways that I had not even known was possible, and feels the pain and good of the world in a very real way. Modern society tends to stamp out the humanity in many people, especially in the Big Apple, but she pulls me back into humanity. Her job at Harlem United allows her to help those who are most in need, and I know she will continue this work once she becomes a doctor. She is clever, funny, and caring, and I am looking forward to spending the rest of my life with her.
